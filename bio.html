		<h1> Joshua Terry's Bio Page </h1>
	
		<p> 

		One of my biggest passions is helping things(ideas, products, and, companies) grow. I'm a big picture thinker, with the technical background to work out the small details. I have experience in product management, market research, financial analysis and user testing. I also have had wide industry exposure spanning from data services, legal research and finance.

		<br><br> I am eagerly pursuing roles that exist at the intersection of technology and business.<br>

		<br>I'm currently a Tufts Junior majoring in Human Factors Engineering; minoring in Entrepreneurship Leadership Studies (Business). A Hackley School graduate, and Reach Prep scholar. <br>
